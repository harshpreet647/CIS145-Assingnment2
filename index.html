    <h2>Variety of coffees available in Coffee Cafe </h2><br>
    <div class="bl">
        <!-- Cappuccino -->
        <h4>Cappuccino</h4>
        <div class="bl1">
            <p style="font-size:26px;font-weight:500;color:chocolate">This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy
                and is loved in the United States as well. It is usually associated 
                with indulgence and comfort due to its thick foam layer and additional 
                flavorings that can be added to it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Americano coffee -->
        <h4>Americano</h4>
        <div class="bl2">
            <p style="font-size:26px;font-weight:500;color: chocolate"> Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated 
                during World War II. Soldiers would add water to their coffee to extend
                their rations farther. The water dilutes the espresso while still 
                maintaining a high level of caffeine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Double Expresso -->
        <h4>Double Expresso</h4><br>
        <div class="bl3">
            <p style="font-size:26px;font-weight:500;color:chocolate">A double espresso may also be listed as doppio, which is the Italian 
                word for double. This drink is highly concentrated and strong.
